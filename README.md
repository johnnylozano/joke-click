## Description
This application generates jokes with the click of a button, utilizing an external API call from 15Dkatz's official_joke_api. https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api

This is a small project that I used to apply asynchronous JS concepts using async, await, and fetch API.

## How to Use
The application will begin with the *setup* portion of a joke. Click the *Tell Joke* button in order to display the other half of the joke. Or the *Get New Joke* button can be pressed in order to generate a completely new joke.
